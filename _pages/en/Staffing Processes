## Fast Track Staffing (3 week turnaround)

A secondment is the temporary move of an employee to another department or agency in the core public administration.
Secondments and assignments are both temporary lateral movements of an employee to perform the functions of a position that already exists or to take on a special project. However, while secondments are to another department (interdepartmental), assignments are within a department or agency (intradepartmental). In both cases, the employee maintains his/her substantive position in the home department/agency or organization, and is paid by the home department/agency or organization.
Note: Home Organisation is the candidateâ€™s incumbent // Host Organisation is CDS
