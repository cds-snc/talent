### Communication channels

* #talent-team on Slack is a private channel with only talent team members. We use this channel for communications relevant only to us. Even though it's hidden, an access to information request could make it public. 
* #people on Slack is a channel for anyone interested in people and culture. We use this channel for any discussion (related to talent) CDS might enjoy.
* We use *email* very little for communication amongst our team. Slack is a better bet.
